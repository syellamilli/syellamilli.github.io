This is the repo for my personal website! Prior to building this, I did not have much 
experience with html, css, or javascript, so it was a fun learning experience. This site
is based off of the Forty template by HTML5 UP. In addition to this, I also used 
https://css-tricks.com/seamless-responsive-photo-grid/ to set up 
my photography gallery.
